### 💬 About Me 

I'm Prasanth, a detail-oriented professional with a background in accounting and reconciliation, now transitioning into data analytics. I currently work at Mondee Tech Pvt. Ltd as an Accounts Specialist, where I manage financial reporting and quality checks for global B2B flight sales. My work involves validating data, resolving discrepancies, and collaborating across teams to streamline operations.
Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in data — not just managing it, but understanding it. I’ve been building dashboards, automating reports, and analyzing patterns using Excel. I’ve been actively learning and applying data analytics skills — including SQL, Power BI, Python — through hands-on projects and coursework. Whether it’s cleaning messy datasets or visualizing trends, I enjoy turning raw numbers into clear, actionable insights.
